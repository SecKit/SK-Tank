PS. Pre-drilled holes are there on the ACM (Aluminum Composite Material) back panel but you can still drill customized holes easily.

PPS. Use your preferred extruder and design a customized adapter based on [SK-Tank BMG adapter STEP file](https://github.com/SecKit/SK-Tank/tree/master/STEP%20files/extruder%20adapter%20-%20BMG) and [SK-Tank extruder carriage STEP file](https://github.com/SecKit/SK-Tank/tree/master/STEP%20files/extruder%20carriage).
