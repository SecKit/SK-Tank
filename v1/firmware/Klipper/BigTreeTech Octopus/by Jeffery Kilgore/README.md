Firmware binary for the Octopus V1.1 STM32F446 USB.  Works with the latest version of Klipper (as of 2/10/22).  Just rename to firmware.bin and place on the microSD card in the Octopus.


Klipper config for Octopus V1.1 - SK-GO - BLTouch - Triple Z - Servo42C Motors


To use it for SK-Tank, you'll have to change the coordinates of Z steppers and Z tilt probe points.
