This spring housing is necessary only for SK-Tank kits sent before 2021 Oct 31st. The constant-force spring acting as a counter-weight at the rear end of the bed is not long enough for the whole Z stroke thus the spring is relocated to bed carriage.


Please slice the spring housing in the orientation as shown in the picture for strength reason.
