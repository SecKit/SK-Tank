Since the height of the X rail will be slightly changed according to XY joiners, the height of X optical endstop attached to the extruder carriage will be changed too. Please print all X endstop fingers and choose one of them which inserts into the endstop and won't collide.

Use **dark color** filament for the finger or **paint it black** to block the optical sensor.
